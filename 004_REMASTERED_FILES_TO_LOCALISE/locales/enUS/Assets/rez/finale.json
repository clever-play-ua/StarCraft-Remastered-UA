    "Value": "Quiet settles over the Black Morass with the blackened, burning remains of the cursed Portal serving as a solemn reminder of the evil that once stood here.  After the long and savage battle, you stand victorious over the tattered remnants of the once mighty Orcish Hordes.  Those Orcs that survived the conflict have fled to the northeast in hopes of escaping your vengeance.  You allow them their reprieve, knowing that the power of the Horde has been forever broken and that the lands of Azeroth belong to its native sons and daughters once again."

    "Value": "The victory pyres burn high into the twilight skies covering the ruined capital of Lordaeron.  Your success has led Orgrim Doomhammer - War Chief of the Orcish Hordes - to elevate you to the station of Warlord, thus giving you power and the command of your own clan.  The Alliance has finally been crushed, with all those surviving being slain and cremated as is dictated by the rituals.  At long last Azeroth and all of its lands belong to the thunderous force known to those foolish enough to stand in its way as the Horde!"
