STR_HUMAN_FINALE,				Quiet settles over the Black Morass with the blackened, burning remains of the cursed Portal serving as a solemn reminder of the evil that once stood here.  After the long and savage battle, you stand victorious over the tattered remnants of the once mighty Orcish Hordes.  Those Orcs that survived the conflict have fled to the northeast in hopes of escaping your vengeance.  You allow them their reprieve, knowing that the power of the Horde has been forever broken and that the lands of Azeroth belong to its native sons and daughters once again.
STR_ORC_FINALE,				The victory pyres burn high into the twilight skies covering the ruined capital of Lordaeron.  Your success has led Orgrim Doomhammer - War Chief of the Orcish Hordes - to elevate you to the station of Warlord, thus giving you power and the command of your own clan.  The Alliance has finally been crushed, with all those surviving being slain and cremated as is dictated by the rituals.  At long last Azeroth and all of its lands belong to the thunderous force known to those foolish enough to stand in its way as the Horde!
#STR_HUMAN_VETERAN_FINALE,	As the sun rises on a new day, golden \
#light falls across the ruined spires of Stormwind Keep.  Many hundreds \
#of Men, Elves and Dwarves have come in pilgrimage to pay homage to \
#their comrades who fell in battle against the Horde.  The sight of \
#the devastated castle calls to mind the terrible losses your forces \
#suffered during the War... yet you remember the glories as well.\n\n\
#As you face the masses who have gathered here this day, your voice \
#carries out across the glade.  "Let the ruins of Stormwind stand as \
#a reminder so that we never break the unity of this Alliance, and that \
#we shall stand ever-vigilant against the darkness that has brought \
#us together!"\n\n\
#Thunderous cries of support erupt from those assembled as all eyes \
#turn to the tattered flag of Azeroth that has been raised atop highest \
#spire of Stormwind Keep.
#
#
#STR_ORC_VETERAN_FINALE,		Long after the clash of steel and the \
#thunder of mighty war cries have faded, the hunger still burns within \
#your warrior's heart.  The Alliance is broken, and its fall has left \
#a disquieting lull in the ravaging dance of the Horde.  The clans have \
#begun to bicker and feud amongst themselves over the jurisdiction of the \
#Alliance's lands.\n\n\
#Even the Doomhammer has let down his guard, lavishing himself with the \
#treasures of his victory.  You however know that only in battle, bathed \
#in the blood of your enemies can the warrior's heart ever be contented.  \
#You reach for your battle-axe, and call your troops to arms...\n\n\
#As your forces clash with the Blackrock clan in a battle for the title \
#of War Chief, you lock gazes with the Doomhammer from across the \
#battlefield.  He raises his warhammer in salute and leaps from his mount \
#into the fray.  You scream to the impartial skies above and join in the \
#battle as well, knowing that this will be a good death.
