1
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:14,890
Who's in charge here?

2
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:20,509
Where is the air support?

3
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:52,849
So...

4
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:55,763
Gerard...

5
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,095
I suspect you have a good reason

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,358
for pulling me away from my ...duties.

7
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,929
Your vodka can wait, my good Alexi.

8
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:10,792
Come, stand here. You need to see this.

9
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:14,525
I know all about the Zerg, Gerard.

10
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:19,516
We've all seen the tapes a hundred...

11
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,945
You've seen nothing!

12
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,049
Dissecting a dead Zerg
in a lab is one thing

13
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:26,548
unleashing them on man is another.

14
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,970
You must go into this with both eyes open.

15
00:02:30,995 --> 00:02:34,574
Once started, there's no going back.

16
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:40,559
Are you prepared
to go all the way with this, Alexi?

17
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:48,898
Yes.

18
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:56,114
Yes, I am prepared
to go all the way, my good admiral.

19
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,888
Good. Good, I knew I could count on you.

20
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,671
Admiral. The colonist's base
will be overrun in a matter of minutes.

21
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:09,218
Shall we intervene?

22
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:13,488
Take us into orbit, Mr. Malmsteen.

23
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,194
We've seen enough.
