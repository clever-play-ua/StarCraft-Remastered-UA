1
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,703
The very mention
of this terrifying race

2
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:19,064
once brought fear to all who heard it.

3
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,151
But now we can all rest easy

4
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:25,541
as our own forces now occupy
their very homeworld of Char.

5
00:00:27,978 --> 00:00:31,795
Months have passed since
our initial confrontation with the Zerg

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,738
and now Directorate forces
have taken control of the planet Char

7
00:00:35,763 --> 00:00:39,984
long since rumored to cradle
the malevolent Overmind of the Zerg.

8
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:44,453
The Overmind itself
an enormous living brain-like entity

9
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,792
dictates control
of all the myriad Zerg forces

10
00:00:47,817 --> 00:00:49,515
and it was believed
to be planning

11
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,991
an invasion of the Earth itself!

12
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:55,904
Once on the offensive
our highly-trained Directorate forces

13
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:58,628
were more than a match
for the beast-like Zerg.

14
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,333
Even their fiercest warrior breed
could not defeat

15
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:04,500
the greatest
military technology in the galaxy.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,253
The Zerg forces on Char
were completely decimated

17
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:10,360
and their losses
were tallied in the millions.

18
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:16,023
But all wars have casualties

19
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:18,825
and while Directorate losses were minimal

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,596
the fleet's Vice-Admiral Stukov

21
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:24,372
gave his life during
the final valiant assault on Char.

22
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:30,874
Memorial services were held

23
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,707
aboard the Directorate flaship,
Aleksander.

24
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:41,668
Vice-Admiral Stukov truly knew
the meaning of sacrifice.

25
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:51,416
Yet his sacrifice was not in vain.

26
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:54,516
The Overmind itself
was the prize of the battle.

27
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,223
Even now, Directorate psychics
and powerful drugs

28
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,383
are keeping the creature pacified.

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,156
The Overmind will undergo
extensive research

30
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:10,967
to ensure the continued safety
of the United Earth Directorate

31
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:13,992
and of all mankind.
