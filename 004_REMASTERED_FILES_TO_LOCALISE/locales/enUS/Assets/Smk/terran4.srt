1
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:16,092
Fellow Terrans,

2
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,840
I come to you in the wake
of recent events

3
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:21,401
to issue a call to reason.

4
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:25,036
Let no human deny the perils of our time.

5
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:26,980
While we battle one another

6
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,472
divided by the petty strife
of our common history

7
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:34,842
the tide of greater conflict
is turning against us

8
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:38,707
threatening to destroy all
that we have accomplished.

9
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:42,456
It is time for us, as nations
and as individuals

10
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,787
to set aside our long-standing feuds
and unite.

11
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:51,249
The tides of an unwinnable war
are upon us.

12
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:54,077
And we must seek refuge upon higher ground

13
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:56,937
lest we be swept away by the flood.

14
00:00:56,962 --> 00:00:59,778
The Confederacy is no more.

15
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:03,097
Whatever semblance of unity
and protection it once provided

16
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:05,497
 is a phantom, a memory.

17
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:07,731
With our enemies left unchecked

18
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:10,351
who will you turn to for protection?

19
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:15,183
The devastation wrought
by the alien invaders is self-evident.

20
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,270
We have seen
our homes and communities destroyed

21
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,588
by the calculated blows of the Protoss.

22
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:23,540
We have seen first-hand
our friends and loved ones

23
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:26,311
consumed by the nightmarish Zerg.

24
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:30,105
Unprecedented and unimaginable
though they may be

25
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,119
these are the signs of our time.

26
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,795
The time has come, my fellow Terrans

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,709
to rally to a new banner.

28
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:39,803
In unity lies strength.

29
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:43,247
Already, many of the dissident factions
have joined us.

30
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:47,262
Out of the many we shall forge
an indivisible whole

31
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:50,949
capitulating only to a single throne

32
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:55,851
and from that throne
I shall watch over you.

33
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,590
From this day forward

34
00:01:57,615 --> 00:02:00,724
let no human make war
upon any other human.

35
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:04,375
Let no Terran agency
conspire against this new beginning

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,645
and let no man consort with alien powers

37
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,788
and to all the enemies of Humanity

38
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,390
seek not to bar our way.

39
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:17,158
For we shall win through
no matter the cost!
