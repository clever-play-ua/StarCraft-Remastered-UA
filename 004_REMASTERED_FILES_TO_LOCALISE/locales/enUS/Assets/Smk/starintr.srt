1
00:00:06,226 --> 00:00:08,278
I can’t see a thing, Jim.

2
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:09,691
Well hold on.

3
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:12,431
I swear, it’s always some damn thing.

4
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:16,533
Wait, got it.
Aw hell, this thing ain’t gonna hold.

5
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,623
Shut up.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,393
Damn you’re ugly.

7
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:26,188
You girls strapped in nice and tight now?

8
00:00:26,213 --> 00:00:28,086
Tighter than your momma’s...

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,040
That’s a good one man.

10
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,708
Locked in and cruising.

11
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,478
What you got for me out there, Joey Ray?

12
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:54,605
We got Terran for sure.
I don’t know about the rest.

13
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,441
We got a big ol’ buttload
of floating debris out here.

14
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,503
We hittin’ pay dirt this time for sure.

15
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:12,082
Explain to me
how we gonna get all this home?

16
00:01:19,092 --> 00:01:23,209
I’m detached and moving toward
the derelict spacecraft.

17
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,560
Damn it Jim, video’s out again.

18
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,782
Well quit picking at it.

19
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,940
I ain’t pickin’ at it, damn it!

20
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,849
I’m out here with a hitch in my giddy up

21
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:36,216
and you’re in there….. (mumbles)
(Spanish) Hey, can you hear me?

22
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,543
(Spanish) They're always talking
when they don't have the...

23
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:41,276
(Spanish) ...leaving me hanging out
here in space doing nothing...

24
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,802
(Spanish) Can you hear me?
Hey, you listening to me?

25
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:45,707
Hold on. I've got visual.

26
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:48,578
It’s a damn bogie, 12 o’clock!
(Spanish) Oh my God, save me Jesus Christ!

27
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:51,399
Up behind the ship! Look behind you Jim!
(Spanish) Mother of God, no!
