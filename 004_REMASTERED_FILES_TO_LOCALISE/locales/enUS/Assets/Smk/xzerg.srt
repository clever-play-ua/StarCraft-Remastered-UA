1
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:10,645
Once again, I stand atop
the broken bodies of my enemies

2
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:14,224
victorious, but not unscarred.

3
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:21,672
The Earth-born Directorate
has been destroyed

4
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,726
and the Overmind lies dead and trampled

5
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,997
beneath the ashes of Char.

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,751
As for my unlikely allies

7
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,529
I think that I shall allow them a reprieve

8
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:40,568
for in time I will seek to test
their resolve and their strengths.

9
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,514
They will all be mine in the end

10
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:46,834
for I am the Queen of Blades.

11
00:00:47,112 --> 00:00:51,128
None shall ever dispute my rule… again.

12
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,699
Dearest Helena

13
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:38,905
by now the news of our defeat
has reached the Earth.

14
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:43,782
The creatures we were sent here
to tame are untamable…

15
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:47,015
And the colonies we were sent to reclaim

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,254
have proven to be stronger
than we anticipated.

17
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:54,515
Whatever you may hear
about what has happened out here

18
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,613
know this: Alexi
did not die gloriously in battle.

19
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,692
I killed him...

20
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,010
my pride killed him.

21
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:09,100
And now my pride has consumed me as well.

22
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:11,772
You will never see me again, Helena.

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,493
Tell our children that I love them

24
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,660
and that their father died
in defense of their future.

25
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,589
Au revoir.
