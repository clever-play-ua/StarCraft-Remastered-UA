Hey Sarge, why we always gotta listen
to this shit for anyway?

2
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,070
Because I'm in charge, that's why.

3
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:31,454
Oh that don't seem like
no good kinda reason to me.

4
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,699
(mumbles)

5
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:34,934
Hey what's that?

6
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,506
Hood ornament, in a second...

7
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,809
SWEET ROVER!

8
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,347
Looks like you mashed
some poor feller's dog, Sarge...

9
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:55,149
It's a Zergling, Lester.
Smaller type of Zerg.

10
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:58,711
They ain't be out this far
unless... oh shit.

11
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,941
I love you sarge!
